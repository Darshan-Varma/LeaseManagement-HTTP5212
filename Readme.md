# Passion Project - Lease Management System

## I have designed Lease Management System as my Passion Project to solve the Housing issues in Canada.

- My Project includes three entities namely House, Owner, Tenants.
- Using my application, you can add new houses, owners and tenant in your database.
- Admin can perform CRUD operations on all three entities.
- One to one relationship between House and owner and many to many relationship between House and tenants.
- Admin can associate an owner with many houses as any individual can own multiple houses at time. 
- If the owner wants to lease his house to any tenant, he can simply select the house and choose tenant from the dropdown. 
- Admin can also associate multiple tenants at a time as we have seen multiple students leasing a particular house at the same time. 
- This application is also useful for Leasing agency who leases multiple houses at a time as we can see all the houses leased by that tenant upon selection.
